NOTE! In Mcu.c only board specific clocks and pin muxing are setup and there is no config tool support. 
So, in order to use for instance FlexCan 3 you need to iniatilize FlexCan3 power control register i.e. ME.PCTL[19].R = 0x01;
in EcuM callout or modify an own version of Mcu.c. See Mcu_InitClock in Mcu.c for further info. 

CAN and LIN: In order to use CAN or LIN the MC33905 circuit need to be initialized accordingly using DSPI. 
             Contact Freescale support for source code. Same init as for mpc5604b_trk.
