  Internal calls are prefixed with Os_<module>. Example Os_TaskResourceFreeAll
 

MEMORY 
  The kernel is designed to be quite modest in allocating RAM. To do this there is a 
  mix of os-resources being allocated as .data and as .bss+const.  
  .data
    Alarms
    + more.
    
  .bss+const
    Tasks:    Const: ~12*4*<task_cnt> bytes.
              Is it worth it? 500 bytes for 10 tasks
    Isr:      Const: ~24*<isr_cnt>
              In a PPC system have lots of ISRs. Only CAN can be easily be 48 interrupts
              so that amounts to 24*48= 1152bytes.                      
 
   Having lots of const data will of course have an impact on speed since RAM is usually 
   much faster than Flash.   
 
 
IMPROVEMENT:
  - Implement a common stack for tasks with same priority (on what level, internal resource?) 
  - PPC, Implement SPE exception and only save 64-bit registers for the tasks that use it. 
         (usually floating point)
